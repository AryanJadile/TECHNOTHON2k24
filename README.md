I developed this website for our college departmental fest to streamline the registration process for various events. It serves as a centralized platform where students can easily register for events, and coordinators can efficiently manage and track all registrations in one place. The website is fully responsive and interactive, providing a seamless user experience across all devices. I carefully selected the color palette to align with the themes and categories of the events, ensuring a visually cohesive and engaging interface.
